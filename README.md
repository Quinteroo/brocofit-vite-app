## Introduction
It is a project focused on tracking daily calorie intake to help with weight control. In this case, I wanted to develop various JavaScript logic problems:
- Calculator with data from a form
- Dynamic filter based on objects in the database
- Rendering a list of objects with their characteristics by obtaining information from the database
- Making modals visible by pressing buttons
- Forms for creating new objects

## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- javaScript ES6+
- VITE

## Installation
No installation required, just follow the link provided at the beginning of the README.


>[!IMPORTANT]
> It is a project focused on Vite and the DOM, so I do not have a database. The array with the information used in the project is in a JS file called db.js.
